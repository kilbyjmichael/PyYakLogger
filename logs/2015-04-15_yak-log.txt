	<message>I don't have any bikini pictures on my tinder, nor do I have any "revealing" ones. My bio is not "suggestive" of hooking up, in fact the complete opposite. So why do guys only want me to hookup still?</message>

		<message>I know tht. But some people have sworn they are in a relationship bc of tinder. Why can't that happen? Even in real life, guys jump to the "fuck" question. Like why?  </message>

		<message>That's why I deleted my tinder because everyone's a hot dog on there. My sister found her perfect man on there, but that's like 1/200 chance. </message>
